   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Run the deployment script:

     ```powershell
     .\deploy.ps1
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**: 
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./deploy.sh
     ./deploy.sh
     ```

#### Manual Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy using Vercel CLI:
   ```bash

Ensure your frontend is configured to connect to the deployed backend:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, set environment variable:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app
   ```

2. For Railway frontend deployment, use:
   ```
